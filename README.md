## 📊 My Portfolio
| Project      | Skill Area      | Description              | Tools      |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------ | ---------- |
| [Health Center Data ELT](https://github.com/tyler-dardis/Health-Center-Data-ELT) | ELT, database management, EDA, data querying | This project was motivated by the limitations of pre-built reports provided on the HRSA website. While high-level summaries were available, I wanted full access to the raw data to enable more granular analysis and custom reporting. To achieve this, I retrieved HRSA's annual UDS data, loaded it into a MySQL database, and performed data wrangling to ensure the dataset was clean and optimized for querying. By building my own SQL queries, I gained the flexibility to extract specific insights not readily available through standard reports. | SQL |
| [Health Center Dashboards](https://github.com/tyler-dardis/Health-Center-Dashboards) | Data visualization, dashboarding | My goal for this project was to transform my health center data into dynamic visualizations that offer deeper insights. To achieve this, I built two Tableau dashboards: one to visualize aggregated national-level data, providing a broad overview of HRSA's health center program, and a second to enable analysis of individual health centers through an interactive dropdown menu, allowing users to select and explore any specific health center’s data. | Tableau |
| [Payer Mix Linear Regression](https://github.com/tyler-dardis/Payer-Mix-Linear-Regression) | Linear regression, lasso regression, supervised machine learning | Accurately predicting payer mix percentages is important for health centers to optimize financial planning and resource allocation. To address this need, I developed linear regression models to predict payer mix distributions based on financial, clinical, and patient demographic data of health centers. | Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn) |
| [NHANES k-means Clustering Analysis](https://github.com/tyler-dardis/NHANES-kmeans-Clustering) | k-means clustering, unsupervised machine learning | To explore patterns and groupings within health-related data, I applied k-means clustering to the NHANES dataset, focusing on key health features such as demographics, lifestyle factors, and clinical measurements. By clustering survey respondents, I was able to identify distinct population segments with similar health profiles within the NHANES dataset. | Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn) |
